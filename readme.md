Perfect. Let’s **update and correct the README** to accurately reflect the real project structure and setup.

---

### ✅ Fix Plan

We'll fix:

1. `.env` explanation
2. Correct working directory (`AFM-web-app-dev_v1.0`)
3. Note that `requirements.txt` is in **root**, not inside `AFM-web-app-dev_v1.0`
4. Add explicit instructions for:
   - activating virtualenv
   - creating `.env` if needed

# Final Portfolio Project: Django Web Application

## Project Overview
This Django web application is the final portfolio project developed by Balogun A.D. and Orngu E.O. as part of our academic journey. It is a culmination of everything we've learned and showcases our ability to design and implement robust, scalable, and feature-rich web solutions.

## Project Features
1. **Dynamic News Display**:
   - Fetches and displays news data (links, authors, and publication dates) dynamically from external sources.
   - Data is cached for performance but not persisted to the database.
   - Pagination included.

2. **Stock & Crypto Profiles**:
   - Displays detailed profiles of listed companies in the stock and crypto markets.

3. **Image Integration**:
   - Uses Pillow to handle logos and other media.

4. **User-Centric Design**:
   - Clean UI/UX with intuitive design, including a centered and bolded sign-up interface.

5. **Django Backend**:
   - Built using Django with ORM, templating system, and solid backend logic.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Django, urllib3, requests, BeautifulSoup
- **Database**: SQLite
- **Libraries**: Pillow, dateutil

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo-url
cd AFM-PROTOTYPE
```

### 2. Create and activate virtual environment
```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # on Windows: env\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> ⚠️ `requirements.txt` is in the root directory.

### 4. Create a `.env` file (if needed)
Create a `.env` in the same folder as `manage.py` with your environment-specific variables like:
```env
DEBUG=True
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
```

### 5. Navigate into Django project directory
```bash
cd AFM-web-app-dev_v1.0
```

### 6. Run migrations
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```
